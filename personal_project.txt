I was asked to design, code, and test C++ satellite flight software for the thermal and power systems for a new 
customer's satellite. On a previous program, this task had been the responsibility of a senior tech lead with 15+ 
years experience, but due to personnel unavailability, I was asked to step up and take responsibility for 
this task. On previous products, this software had bee hard to configure for different mission phases in the product 
life cycle, leading to costly time delays in pre-launch ground testing, and during on-orbit missions. By working with the 
thermal and power hardware tech leads, as well as software leads, I was able to implement a software solution 
that integrated with the existing software platform and was highly reconfigurable. This ease of use saved time
in the expensive space simulated ground testing which ran in the order of $1 million / day in test costs.  Additionally 
this reconfigurability made on orbit operations smoother, saving time in what can be life or death situations 
for the customer's product.
